			<p>Creative Commons (CC) licensing is most associated with creative works. Stock photos, PSD templates, icon sets, UI kits, the like.
But CC licenses aren’t well-suited for open source code. Or, rather, there were better open source licensing options, even at the time jQuery was released.
Even the folks at Creative Commons recommend that we use free and open source licensing such as MIT or GPL for software. The Open Source Initiative, an organization dedicated to promoting open source software, is against releasing open source code under certain Creative Commons licenses.
Resig acknowledges that using a CC Attribution-ShareAlike license for jQuery was a “poor choice.”
The project’s licensing switched to the MIT license soon after.</p>

			<h2>3. jQuery was created without a version control system.</h2>

			<p>Today it would be unimaginable for an open source project to be released without using a version control system (VCS) such as Git. Like, how would you even post it up on GitHub?
But the founder of jQuery didn’t use a VCS while developing the initial source code of the project.
To be fair: not using a VCS — even on big projects — was common during the time jQuery was released.
The jQuery project eventually started using version control (it went with SVN) only after Resig received contributions to his JS library.</p>
